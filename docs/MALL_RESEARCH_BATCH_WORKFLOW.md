# MallMind Mall Research Batch Workflow

Sprint 9E/9F/9G · MallMind Navigator

---

## Purpose

The Mall Research Batch Workflow is a controlled admin workspace for collecting, organising, and reviewing raw data findings for a specific mall — across multiple sessions — before any data is considered for live database application.

**Core guarantee:**
- **Nothing in this workflow writes to `shops`, `products`, or `mall_nodes`.**
- All writes are limited to `mall_research_batches` and `mall_research_batch_items` (staging tables only).
- An admin must take a separate, explicit apply action (via the Live Data Apply Planner Bot) to move data to live tables.

---

## Concepts

### Batch
A **batch** is a named collection of findings for one research session targeting a single mall. Examples:
- "Sandton City — May 2026 phone survey"
- "Mall of Africa — floor layout update Q2 2026"
- "Gateway — new store openings June 2026"

### Batch Item (Finding)
A **batch item** is a single raw data point collected during the research session — a text observation, a source URL, an extracted detail, or a combination. Items have a **finding type** that categorises what was observed.

### Status flow
```
Batch:   open → in_progress → complete
                            ↘ archived
```
```
Item:    pending → reviewed → accepted
                           ↘ rejected
                           ↘ flagged
```

---

## Data Flow

```
Admin opens/creates a batch for a mall
  → Admin adds findings (raw text + source URL) as batch items
  → Admin runs Data Intelligence Bots on each item:
      Source Research Bot   → validates source URL safety
      Finding Extractor Bot → extracts prices, unit codes, hours
      Duplicate Detection Bot → checks for existing DB matches
      Data Guardian         → assigns trust level + confidence
      Admin Review Assistant Bot → synthesises all bot outputs
  → Admin reviews each item (accept / reject / flag)
  → [optional] Admin runs Live Data Apply Planner Bot → gets field-level patch plan
  → Admin marks batch complete
  → SEPARATE EXPLICIT APPLY ACTION required to write to live tables
  → Audit log records every step
```

## Database Schema

### `mall_research_batches`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | UUID PK | auto-generated |
| `mall_id` | UUID FK → malls | nullable |
| `title` | TEXT NOT NULL | human-readable name for the batch |
| `description` | TEXT | optional detail |
| `status` | TEXT | `open` · `in_progress` · `complete` · `archived` |
| `notes` | TEXT | free-form admin notes |
| `item_count` | INTEGER | denormalised — incremented on item add |
| `reviewed_count` | INTEGER | denormalised — incremented on first review of an item |
| `created_by` | UUID FK → auth.users | admin who created the batch |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | auto-managed by trigger |

### `mall_research_batch_items`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | UUID PK | auto-generated |
| `batch_id` | UUID FK → mall_research_batches | cascades on delete |
| `sequence_number` | INTEGER | optional ordering hint |
| `finding_type` | TEXT | `shop` · `product` · `trading_hours` · `floor_layout` · `promotion` · `other` |
| `raw_text` | TEXT | free-form observation text |
| `source_url` | TEXT | URL of the data source |
| `source_name` | TEXT | human-readable source name |
| `status` | TEXT | `pending` · `reviewed` · `accepted` · `rejected` · `flagged` |
| `admin_notes` | TEXT | review notes from admin |
| `bot_hints_used` | JSONB | JSON snapshot of bot outputs used as reference |
| `extracted_data` | JSONB | structured data extracted during review — staging only |
| `reviewed_by` | UUID FK → auth.users | admin who reviewed the item |
| `reviewed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | timestamp of first review action |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | auto-managed by trigger |

**RLS:** Both tables require `profiles.is_admin = true`. The backend service role bypasses RLS.

## Bot Integration

The Research Batch Workflow is designed to be used alongside the Data Intelligence Bot Suite (Sprint 9C). The recommended order for each batch item:

### Step 1 — Source Research Bot
```
POST /admin/data-bots/source-research
{ "source_url": "<item.source_url>", "source_name": "<item.source_name>" }
```
→ Validates source isn't Google Maps / Yelp. Returns `source_category` and `trust_ceiling`.

### Step 2 — Finding Extractor Bot
```
POST /admin/data-bots/extract-finding
{ "raw_text": "<item.raw_text>", "hint_finding_type": "<item.finding_type>" }
```
→ Extracts prices, unit codes, floor labels, hours from raw text.

### Step 3 — Duplicate Detection Bot
```
POST /admin/data-bots/detect-duplicates
{ "finding_type": "shop", "name": "<extracted shop name>", "mall_id": "<batch.mall_id>" }
```
→ Returns match candidates from existing `shops` / `products` rows.

### Step 4 — Data Guardian
```
POST /admin/data-guardian/review
{ "raw_text": "<item.raw_text>", "source_url": "<item.source_url>", ... }
```
→ Assigns `trust_level` and `confidence_score`.

### Step 5 — Admin Review Assistant Bot (optional)
```
POST /admin/data-bots/review-assistant
{ "guardian_result": {...}, "source_result": {...}, "duplicate_result": {...}, "extractor_result": {...} }
```
→ Synthesises all results into a prioritised action list.

### Step 6 — Live Data Apply Planner Bot (when trust level ≥ admin_verified)
```
POST /admin/data-bots/plan-apply
{ "finding_type": "shop", "trust_level": "admin_verified", "confidence_score": 85, "structured_data": {...} }
```
→ Returns a field-level patch plan — **NEVER writes to live tables.**

## Frontend: Research Batches Tab

The admin UI exposes the workflow as the **Research Batches** tab in the Admin Dashboard (8th tab, requires backend).

### Batch list view
- Lists all batches, newest first
- Filter by status
- One-click to open a batch

### Batch detail view
- Shows all items with status badges
- Expandable item rows: raw text, source URL, bot hint shortcuts, action buttons
- Quick actions per item: Accept · Reject · Flag · Mark Reviewed
- Admin notes textarea per item
- Add Finding form: finding type + raw text + source URL
- Batch status transitions: open → in_progress → complete / archived
- Progress stats: total items · pending · accepted · rejected

### Bot hints in the UI
Each batch item shows a hint strip pointing to the 4 bots to run:
> Source Research · Find & Extract · Check Duplicates · Data Guardian
> All bots are in the **Bot Suite** tab.

---

## Why No Automatic Updates

The batch workflow is a research and review tool — not an import pipeline. The same reasons that motivate the Bot Suite's `must_not_update_live_data` guarantee apply here:

1. Raw text may contain errors, guesses, or outdated information.
2. Sources may be unreliable, unverified, or policy-restricted.
3. Exact duplicate matching is probabilistic — human confirmation is required.
4. Trust level must meet a minimum gate (`admin_verified`) before a patch plan can be generated.

The admin is always the final decision-maker.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| `Cannot add items to an archived batch` | Change batch status to `open` or `in_progress` first |
| Item stays `pending` after review | Only the first transition from `pending` to a reviewed state records `reviewed_by` and `reviewed_at` |
| `item_count` seems stale | The count is updated fire-and-forget — refresh the batch detail to get the accurate item list count |
| Batch not visible in list | Check the status filter — it may be filtering to a specific status |

---

---

## One-Click Bot Pipeline (Sprint 9F)

Each batch item now has direct bot action buttons — no need to copy-paste text between Research Batches and the Bot Suite tab.

### What each button does

| Button | Bot | What it uses from the item |
|--------|-----|---------------------------|
| **Source** | Source Research Bot | `source_url`, `source_name`, `raw_text` (as description) |
| **Extract** | Finding Extractor Bot | `raw_text`, `finding_type` as hint |
| **Guardian** | Data Guardian | `raw_text`, `source_url`, `finding_type`, `batch.mall_id`, `extracted_data`, source_research result |
| **Duplicate** | Duplicate Detection Bot | Shop/product name from extractor output or `extracted_data`, `batch.mall_id` |
| **Review** | Admin Review Assistant | All previously run bot outputs in `bot_hints_used` |
| **Run Full Pipeline** | All 5 bots in sequence | Everything above, step by step |

### Why outputs are saved to `bot_hints_used`

`bot_hints_used` is a JSONB staging field on each batch item. It is the only field that bot pipeline writes touch — no `shops`, `products`, or `mall_nodes` are touched. Storing outputs here lets the admin:
- Re-open a batch item days later and see prior bot analysis
- Run individual bots in any order
- Pass all outputs to Admin Review Assistant for a synthesised recommendation
- Keep a full audit trail of bot reasoning

### Storage format

```json
{
  "source_research":     { ... SourceResearchResult ... },
  "finding_extractor":   { ... FindingExtractorResult ... },
  "data_guardian":       { ... DataGuardianResult ... },
  "policy_result":       { ... TrustPolicyResult ... },
  "duplicate_detection": { ... DuplicateDetectionResult ... },
  "admin_review":        { ... AdminReviewAssistantResult ... },
  "pipeline": {
    "last_run_at": "2026-05-13T10:00:00.000Z",
    "steps_completed": ["source_research", "finding_extractor", "data_guardian", "policy_result", "duplicate_detection", "admin_review"],
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

`policy_result` is saved separately after the Data Guardian runs so the Truth Status block in the UI can render without inspecting the full guardian output. It contains the 12-state `trust_state`, `evidence_strength`, `source_quality`, `freshness_state`, `conflict_risk`, `manual_review_priority`, `safe_badge`, `allowed_next_actions`, `blocked_actions`, and `must_not_update_live_data`.

### Why live data is not updated automatically

1. Bot outputs are advisory — deterministic rules applied to unverified text.
2. Trust level must be `admin_verified` (rank 4/7) or higher before even a patch *plan* can be generated.
3. Even a patch plan requires a separate, explicit admin apply action to write to `shops`/`products`.
4. Item status is never changed by a bot run — the admin clicks Accept/Reject/Flag manually.

### Suggested workflow for a new mall (e.g. Mall@Reds)

1. Create a batch: "Mall@Reds — June 2026 survey"
2. For each shop/price finding, add a batch item with raw text + source URL
3. For each item, click **Run Full Pipeline**
4. Check the "Bot Outputs" panel:
   - **Source Research**: is the source trusted? Is it blocked by policy?
   - **Finding Extractor**: did it extract the right shop name, floor, unit?
   - **Data Guardian**: what trust level and confidence score did it assign?
   - **Duplicate Detection**: is there already a Game / Woolworths entry for this mall?
   - **Admin Recommendation**: what's the synthesised action?
5. Read the "Bot suggestion" banner for the top recommended action
6. Make your decision — click Accept, Reject, or Flag
7. When a batch item is accepted with sufficient trust, use the Bot Suite → Live Data Apply Planner to generate a patch plan
8. Apply patch manually via direct DB access or a future Apply workflow

### Example — Mall@Reds Game item

**Raw text:**
> Game is listed as Shop G01 on Ground Floor. Category Electronics.

**Expected bot outputs after pipeline:**
- Source Research: `source_category: unknown`, `risk_level: medium` (no source URL)
- Finding Extractor: extracts `shop_name: Game`, `floor: Ground Floor`, `unit_code: G01`
- Data Guardian: `trust_level: user_submitted` (no official source), `confidence_score: ~30`
- Duplicate Detection: finds existing Game shop if `mall_id` is set, returns `link_to_existing` recommendation
- Admin Review: `overall_risk: medium`, suggests "Needs admin cross-check — duplicate candidate found"

**Admin decision:** Review the duplicate candidate. If it's the same Game shop, reject this item (already exists). If it's a new location, accept and run Apply Planner.

### How to interpret bot recommendations

| Recommendation | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| `proceed` | Source is trusted — safe to continue |
| `proceed_with_caution` | Semi-official source — cross-check recommended |
| `needs_admin_review` | Low-trust or ambiguous — human must decide |
| `reject` | Policy block or no data — do not use |
| `create_new` | No duplicate found — safe to create a new record |
| `link_to_existing` | Match found — verify and link to existing record |
| `approve_for_admin_review` | Guardian says trust is sufficient for admin to decide |

### What to do after Admin Review Assistant recommends an action

The Admin Review Assistant shows a **suggestion banner** in the item row. It is advisory only.

- If it says "Accept" → verify the extracted data looks correct, then click **Accept**
- If it says "Reject" or "BLOCKED" → click **Reject** and add a note
- If it says "needs_more_info" → click **Flag** and note what's missing
- Never click Accept just because the bot said so — always read the raw text and extractor output

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| `Cannot add items to an archived batch` | Change batch status to `open` or `in_progress` first |
| Item stays `pending` after review | Only the first transition from `pending` to a reviewed state records `reviewed_by` and `reviewed_at` |
| `item_count` seems stale | The count is updated fire-and-forget — refresh the batch detail to get the accurate item list count |
| Batch not visible in list | Check the status filter — it may be filtering to a specific status |
| Bot action buttons unresponsive | Ensure the backend URL is configured (`VITE_GOOGLE_BACKEND_URL`) and you are logged in as admin |
| Pipeline halted at source_research | Source URL matched a restricted pattern (Google Maps etc.) — use mall's official website |
| Finding Extractor extracts nothing | Raw text may be too short or contain no structured signals — add more detail |
| Duplicate bot returns no candidates | Check that `batch.mall_id` is set and the item's shop name is spelled correctly |
| Admin Review returns no actions | Run at least one other bot first — Admin Review synthesises prior bot outputs |

## Roadmap

- **Sprint 10:** "Apply to live data" button on accepted items with `trust_level >= admin_verified` — calls Live Data Apply Planner then admin confirm → actual `UPDATE`
- **Sprint 11:** Bulk import — paste a list of raw text observations → auto-creates one item per line
- **Sprint 13:** Mall comparison batches — compare findings across multiple batches for the same mall over time
